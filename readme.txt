new project
this is the first project editted on 12/04
The project is based on Stoet et al. (2013) Are women better than men at multi-tasking? You can read this article in 'literature.pdf'
I first use the 'stimuli.py' to create 4 types of stimuli necessary for the task, and save them as 4 png accessible in the file folder
Then I use the multitask.py to run the experiment in expyriment. It needs the 4 png files to run successfully.
