new project
this is the first project editted on 12/04
The project is based on Stoet et al. (2013) Are women better than men at multi-tasking? You can read this article in 'literature.pdf'
The aim of the experiment is to test people's ability to do multi-tasking. There are two types of task, counting and shape judgment. The participants are required to accomplish the task based on the stimulus' location on the screen. Then they need to response by pressing keys on the keyboard: either they report the shape to be square or diamond, or they report the number of dots in the shape to be 2 or 3.
I first use the 'stimuli.py' to create 4 types of stimuli necessary for the task, and save them as 4 png accessible in the file folder
Then I use the multitask.py to run the experiment in expyriment. It needs the 4 png files to run successfully.
